A project is a folder that contains a ``anaconda-project.yml`` configuration file together with scripts, notebooks, and other files. A project is usually compressed into a ``.tar.bz2`` file for sharing and storing.

Data scientists use projects to encapsulate data science projects and make them easily portable. The configuration file can include: commands, variables, services, downloads, packages, channels and env_specs.

Anaconda Project automates setup steps, so that data scientists can just type ``anaconda-project run`` and have their project deployment Just Work.
