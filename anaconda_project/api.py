"""All-in-one public API module.

It's OK to use anything in anaconda_project as well, but anything
with an underscore prefix or inside ``anaconda_project.internal``
is considered private.

In this file, we try to export the interesting high-level
operations in one place so they are easy to find and import.  It
is a redundant but hopefully convenient wrapper around the entire
API.

        This method takes any needed actions such as creating
        environments or starting services, without asking the user
        for permission.

        This method returns a result object. The result object has
        a ``failed`` property.  If the result is failed, the
        ``errors`` property has the errors.  If the result is not
        failed, the ``command_exec_info`` property has the stuff
        you need to run the project's default command, and the
        ``environ`` property has the updated environment. The
        passed-in ``environ`` is not modified in-place.

        You can update your original environment with
        ``result.update_environ()`` if you like, but it's probably
        a bad idea to modify ``os.environ`` in that way because
        the calling app won't want to have the project
        environment.

        The ``environ`` should usually be kept between
        preparations, starting out as ``os.environ`` but then
        being modified by the user.

        If the project has a non-empty ``problems`` attribute,
        this function returns the project problems inside a failed
        result. So ``project.problems`` does not need to be checked in
        advance.
