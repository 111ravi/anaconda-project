"""All-in-one public API module.

It's OK to use anything in anaconda_project as well, but anything
with an underscore prefix or inside ``anaconda_project.internal``
is considered private.

In this file, we try to export the interesting high-level
operations in one place so they are easy to find and import.  It
is a redundant but hopefully convenient wrapper around the entire
API.

        "Locally" means a machine where development will go on,
        contrasted with say a production deployment.

        This method takes any needed actions such as creating
        environments or starting services, without asking the user
        for permission.

        This method returns a result object. The result object has
        a ``failed`` property.  If the result is failed, the
        ``errors`` property has the errors.  If the result is not
        failed, the ``command_exec_info`` property has the stuff
        you need to run the project's default command, and the
        ``environ`` property has the updated environment. The
        passed-in ``environ`` is not modified in-place.

        You can update your original environment with
        ``result.update_environ()`` if you like, but it's probably
        a bad idea to modify ``os.environ`` in that way because
        the calling app won't want to have the project
        environment.

        The ``environ`` should usually be kept between
        preparations, starting out as ``os.environ`` but then
        being modified by the user.

        If the project has a non-empty ``problems`` attribute,
        this function returns the project problems inside a failed
        result. So ``project.problems`` does not need to be checked in
        advance.
