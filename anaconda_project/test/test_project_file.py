#
# Here you can configure the requirements to run your code, such as
# packages, configuration, and services.
# If you run your code with the 'anaconda-project launch' command, or with
# project-aware tools such as Anaconda Navigator, the tools will be smart
# about checking for and meeting your requirements.
#
# The file is in YAML format, please see http://www.yaml.org/start.html for more.
# (But often you don't have to edit this file by hand!
# Try the anaconda-project command or Anaconda Navigator to set up your project.)
#
# If you want to edit by hand, here are some of the things you can set.
#
# Set the 'name' key to name your project:
# name: myproject
#
# Set the 'icon' key to give your project an icon in Navigator:
# icon: myicon.png
#
#

#
# In the commands section, list your runnable scripts, notebooks, and other code.
# You can give each item a name, and use it with anaconda-project launch, like this:
#     anaconda-project launch --command myscript
# Without the --command option, 'anaconda-project launch' will run the command named
# 'default', or the first command listed.
# Any .ipynb files in the project directory are added automatically and don't need
# to be listed here, but you can if you like.
#
# For example,
#
# commands:
#    default:
#       shell: echo "This project is in $PROJECT_DIR"
#       windows: echo "This project is in "%PROJECT_DIR%
#    myscript:
#       shell: main.py
#    my_bokeh_app:
#       bokeh_app: the_app_directory_name
#    my_notebook:
#       notebook: foo.ipynb
#
# Commands may have both a Unix shell version and a Windows cmd.exe version.
# In this example, my_notebook was automatically added as a command named
# 'foo.ipynb' but we've manually added it as 'my_notebook' also.
#
commands: {}
#
# In the runtime section, list any environment variables your code depends on.
#
# For example,
#
# runtime:
#    EC2_PASSWORD: null
#    NUMBER_OF_ITERATIONS: null
#
# If you give a value other than null for the variable, that value will be the default
# for everyone who runs this project.
# You can also set a local value (not shared with others) in project-local.yml.
#
runtime: {}
#
# In the downloads section, list any URLs to download to local files
# before your code runs.
# Each local filename is placed in an environment variable.
#
# For example,
#
# downloads:
#    MY_DATA_FILE: http://example.com/data.csv
#    ANOTHER_DATA_FILE: {
#      url: http://example.com/foo.csv
#      sha1: adc83b19e793491b1c6ea0fd8b46cd9f32e592fc
#      filename: local-name-for-foo.csv
#    }
#
# In this example, the MY_DATA_FILE environment variable would
# contain the full path to a local copy of data.csv, while
# ANOTHER_DATA_FILE would contain the full path to a local copy
# named local-name-for-foo.csv
#
downloads: {}
#
# In the dependencies section, list any packages that must be installed
# before your code runs.
# These packages will be installed in ALL Conda environments used for
# this project.
#
# For example,
# dependencies:
#    - bokeh=0.11.1
#    - numpy
#
dependencies: []
#
# In the channels section, list any Conda channel URLs to be searched
# for packages. These channels will be used by ALL Conda environments
# this project runs in.
#
# For example,
#
# channels:
#    - https://conda.anaconda.org/asmeurer
#
channels: []
#
# If you like, you can define multiple, named Conda environments.
# There's an implicit environment called 'default', which you can
# tune by naming it explicitly here. When you launch a command, use
# the --environment option to choose an environment.
#    anaconda-project launch --environment python27
#
# Each environment may have 'dependencies' or 'channels' sub-sections
# which are combined with any global 'dependencies' or 'channels'.
#
# For example,
#
# environments:
#   default:
#     dependencies:
#       - bokeh
#     channels:
#       - https://conda.anaconda.org/asmeurer
#   python27:
#     dependencies:
#       - python=2.7
